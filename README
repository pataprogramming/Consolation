Consolation is intended to bring the web into your console in a form
suitable for consumption by UNIX scripts.  This is hardly an original
idea, of course. Surfraw, for example (http://surfraw.alioth.debian.org/)
provides a one-way street from the command-line to web search engines
and other Internet data sources.  Consolation will close the loop by also
returning nicely-parsed results in a form suitable for either piping to
other scripts or simply viewing as quiet text in your terminal window.

In its present form, Consolation is pre-pre-release software, executable
notes written in order to feel out the design space.  There is only
a single rudimentary script at the moment, google.rb, that accepts search
terms as arguments and returns the first ten URLs from Google, one
per line.

Consolation depends on Hpricot, which should be installed using gem or
your operating system's package management system.
